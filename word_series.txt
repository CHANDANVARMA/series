Q. Consider the following series:

    A := 1
    B := A*2 + 2
    C := B*2 + 3 and so on...

Write a program that:

    1. outputs the number corresponding to a given letter
    2. given a string of letters like 'GREP', computes the sum of the numbers 
       corresponding to all the letters in the string (i.e., G + R + E + P), as
       given by the above series
    3. given a large number (that would fit into a standard 32-bit integer), 
       finds the shortest string of letters corresponding to it.

You may use a greedy approach for the last part. Compute the values of the
numbers corresponding to letters as and when required and DO NOT pre-compute
beforehand and store them in a data structure.
You may attempt this problem in any programming language.
